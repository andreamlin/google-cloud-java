# Developer Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help in development of this client. Specifically to test out
changes in the autogenerated protobufs and GAPIC client before publishing the changes to googleapis.

- update-deps.sh downloads dependencies needed to regenerate the protobufs and the GAPIC client.
  It will stage everything in `deps/`. It can be run again to refresh the dependencies. It will
  try rebase any changes that are committed locally in the dependency.

- regenerate.sh is used to regenerate the base GAPIC layer. It will regenerate the protobufs and 
  all of the GAPIC classes in this project. 

- autogen_files.lst and handwritten_files.lst track the origin of the files in `src/`, they will be
  updated when `regenerate.sh` is run
